# Scientific Method

1. Question
2. Hypothesis
3. Experiment <br/> ordered investigation that attempts to prove or disprove a hypothesis
  - must show if hypothesis is supported or not.
  - results must be measurable
  - experiment must be repeatable
4. Observation <br/> make observations about results of experiment
5. Analysis <br/> run test
6. Conclusion <br/> significant result


---

# Question - Causality


Assess whether a particular agent 

(e.g. a medication or drug or treatment regime or exposure to an environmental factor)

caused or influenced a particular outcome 

(e.g. cure of disease, reduction in pain, medical condition, change in protein expression etc.)

---

# Question - Causality - Bradford-Hill Criteria


1.  Strength of association – (effect size) the greater the effect compared with those not
exposed to the agent the more plausible is the association
--

2. Consistency – (reproducibility) does it happen in other groups of people – both men and
women, different countries
--

3. Specificity – no other likely explanations - Causation is likely if there is a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation.
--

4. Temporality – effect follows cause, and if expected delay, effect must occur after that delay
--

5.  Biological gradient – the stronger the agent the greater the effect – 
response follow dose but also inverse effects possible
--

6.  Plausibility – is there a possible biological mechanism that could explain
the effect
--

7. Coherence – do different types of study result in similar conclusions – con-
trolled trials and observational studies
--

9. Analogous results found elsewhere – do similar agents have similar results?

# Question - Causality - Bradford-Hill Criteria


- Are there other scientifically relevant questions than causality?
- What is your research question?
- Which B-H criteria do you aim to establish?
- Does establishing every one of these prove cause and effect?
- Can we infer causal models from data?

# Study Types 

.pull-left[
## Observational study
- subjects are observed in order to determine both their exposure and their outcome (e.g. healthy cancer)
- not randomized to the exposed or unexposed groups
- The exposure status is not determined by the researcher
]

.pull-right[
## Experiment
- experiment must be repeatable
- subjects are randomized to the exposed and unexposed groups
]

---


.pull-left[
## Observational study
- Case-control study -  only individuals with a specific characteristic (disease and similar individuals without disease)
- Cross-sectional study - aim to provide data on the entire population under study
- Longitudinal study - repeated observations of the same variables (e.g., people) over short or long periods of time
]

.pull-right[
## Experiment
- randomized controlled trials

# Randomized controlled trial

Aims to reduce certain sources of __bias__

Bias is an inclination towards something, or a predisposition, partiality, prejudice, preference, or predilection.

- Confirmation bias,<br/> tendency to favor information that confirm hypothesis

--

- Funding bias,<br/> bias relative to the commercial interests of a study's financial sponsor
--

- Publication bias,<br/> bias towards publication of certain experimental results

# Randomized controlled trial

Aims to reduce certain sources of __bias__

- Randomly allocate subjects to two or more groups
 - selection and allocation bias
- Blinding
 - Information which may influence the participants is withheld until after the experiment is completed
 - A blind can be imposed on any participant of an experiment, including __subjects, researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators__

e.g.:

- more care when processing treated samples than controls,
- data analysts tweaks thresholds till obtaining expected output.


---

What is selection bias?

--
sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed

--

What is allocation bias?

--

systematic difference in how participants are assigned to treatment groups and comparison groups

---

# Blindness of trials

- Single blind – either patient or evaluator blind.
- Double blind – both patient and evaluator blind.

Good practice is that double blind trials should be used where possible

--

How could you blind the data analyst?

--

- avoid confirmation bias
  - use uninformative group labels
  - do not discuss analysis outcomes - i.e. this is super interesting etc.

# Confounders

- Confounding is a causal concept.
- It is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association.

# Confounders

- Avoid batch effects:
    - process all samples in parallel

- If unavoidable, randomize over 
  biological and technical co-variates. e.g. sex, age, in MS Run ID.

- If randomization is not possible, choose a complete block design, i.e., all batch groups (e.g. sex) are
present in each treatment group in equal numbers. _blocking_

# Confounders

.pull-left[

Document any possible co-variate, e.g.,

  - Human subjects: age, bmi, gender, ethnicity, tissue,
medical center
  -  Cellular model: cell batch, passage number, reagent
lot no, name of technician, sequencing lane, date of
experiment, date of sequencing

# Ethical considerations (Clinical Trial)

(Declaration of Helsinki (1964+amendments))
https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/


- The local ethics committee has discretion on how it will supervise __noninterventional__ studies
  -  US - Institutional Review Board (IRB)
  -  EU - ethics committees

# Ethical considerations (Clinical Trial)

- It is agreed that it is unethical to conduct research which is badly planned or
executed.
-  It is unethical to perform a trial which has many more subjects than are needed to
reach a conclusion.
- It is also unethical to
perform a trial which has little prospect of reaching any conclusion, e.g. because
of insufficient numbers of subjects (or some other aspect of poor design)

---

# Sample size calculations 

For each statistical test, there exists a unique
relation between

- desired smallest detectable effect size $\mu$
- sample variance $\sigma^2$
- sample size $N$
- critical p-value $p_0$
- statistical power
