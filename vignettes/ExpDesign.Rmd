# Question of Causality

.pull-left[
Assess whether a particular __agent__ 
caused or influenced a particular __outcome__

- What is probability that A originates from B?
- What is probability that B generates A?

# Judgement under uncertainty - Heuristics and biases

In answering these question people typically rely on;

- __representativeness__ heuristic,
  - i.e. when A is highly representative of B, the probability that A originates form B is judged to be high.
   (Bat and Bird , Frog and Tadpole)
- __availability__ heuristic
  - retrievability - how easily information can be brought to mind
  - imaginability - how easy is it to explain outcomes (a good story sells)
  - bias due to illusory correlations - frequency of co-occurrence
- __anchoring__ heuristic
  - insufficient adjustment
  - assessment of uncertainty - typically under-estimated

# Judgement under uncertainty - Heuristics and biases


But people are insensitive to:
- to prior probability of outcome
- to sample size
- to predictability (predict future based on observations made now).
- illusion of validity caused by consistency  $^{\star}$
- misconception of regression - confounding $^{\star\star}$



.footnote[
$^{\star}$ but consistent patterns are most often observed when input variables are highly redundant or correlated. Hence people tend to have great confidence in predictions based on redundant input variables.<br/>

$^{\star\star}$ Because the instructors had praised their trainees after good landings and admonished them after poor
 ones, they reached the erroneous and potentially harmful conclusion that punishment is more effective than reward.

# Judgement under uncertainty - Heuristics and biases

Imagine an urn filled with balls, of which 2/3 are of one color and 1/3 of another.

- One individual (__A__) has drawn $5$ balls from the urn, and found that $4$ were red and $1$ was white. 
- Another (__B__) has drawn $20$ balls and found that $12$ were red and $8$ were white. 

Which of the two individuals should feel more confident that the urn contains $2/3$ red balls and $1/3$ white balls, rather than the opposite? 

What odds should each individual give?

- Odds for __A__ (5 balls : 4 red; 1 white) =

# Causality - Bradford-Hill Criteria


1.  __Strength of association__ – (effect size) the greater the effect compared with those not
exposed to the agent the more plausible is the association
2. __Consistency__ – (reproducibility) does it happen in other groups of people – both men and
women, different countries
3. __Specificity__ – no other likely explanations
4. __Temporality__ – effect follows cause, and if expected delay, effect must occur after that delay
5.  __Biological gradient__ – the stronger the agent the greater the effect
6.  __Plausibility__ – is there a possible biological mechanism that could explain the effect
7. __Coherence__ – do different types of study result in similar conclusions – e.g., controlled trials and observational studies
8. __Experiment__ "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".
<!-- 9. Analogous results found elsewhere – do similar agents have similar results?-->

A randomized controlled trial is a type of scientific experiment that aims to reduce certain sources of __bias__ when testing the effectiveness of new treatments.

- __selection bias__ 
    - sample obtained is _not representative_ of the population intended to be analyzed.
- __allocation bias__ 
    - _systematic difference_ in how participants are assigned to treatment groups and comparison groups
    - __Randomly allocate subjects to two or more groups__

- In clinical Trials double blind trials should <br/>
be used where possible

  - __Double blind__ – both patient and evaluator blind

- To prevent __ascertainment__ and __performance__ __bias__.

Correlation does not imply causation but causation may imply correlation.

# Confounders - Example

- Flight Training Experienced instructors noted: 
  - that praise for an exceptionally smooth landing is typically followed by a poorer landing on the next try.
  - harsh criticism after a rough landing is usually followed by an improvement on the next try.
The instructors concluded that verbal rewards are detrimental to learning while punishments are beneficial, contrary to accepted psychological doctrine.

# Confounders - Controlling for

  e.g. run Id, age.

_complete block design_, i.e.,<br/> 
all treatments are present in each batch<br/>
in equal numbers.

Within (repeated/paired)

# Sample Size - Ethical considerations

- It is agreed that it is __unethical__ _to conduct research which is badly planned or
executed_.

-  It is unethical to perform a trial which:
  - has _many more subjects_ than are needed to reach a conclusion.
  - has little prospect of reaching any conclusion, <br/> e.g. because 
  of _insufficient numbers of subjects_ (or some other aspect of poor design)

- The local ethics committee has discretion on how it will supervise __non-interventional__ studies
  -  US - Institutional Review Board (IRB)
  -  EU - ethics committees

# Sample Size - Types of error


A __type I error__ (false positive) occurs when<br/> the null hypothesis (H0) is true, but is rejected.<br/> 
The _type I error rate_ or __significance level__ (p-Value)<br/> is the probability of rejecting the<br/> 
null hypothesis given that it is true.


A __type II error__ (false negative) occurs when<br/> 
the null hypothesis is false,<br/>
but erroneously fails to be rejected. <br/>
The _the type II error rate_ is denoted by the Greek letter $\beta$<br/>
and is related to the __power of a test__ (which equals $1−\beta$).

For a given test, the only way to reduce both error rates<br/> 
is to __increase the sample size__, and this may not be feasible.

# Sample Size - Sample size calculation

.footnote[Top - greater standard deviation requires larger sample sizes, Bottom - smaller effect size requires larger sample sizes]

.pull-left[
For each statistical test,<br/> 
there exists a unique relation between:

- desired smallest detectable effect size $\mu$
- sample variance $\sigma^2$
- sample size $N$
- critical p-value $p_0$
- statistical power

# Conclusion

- Understand what heuristics we use to make judgements and what biases might arise.
- The scientific method
- Bradford hill criteria
- randomization, blinding
- sample size estimation
